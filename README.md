## Introduction

The Password Complexity Checker is a Python application designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on several criteria such as length, use of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It provides real-time feedback, including an estimated time to crack the password. The application also features a random password generator to help users create secure passwords.

## Features

- **Real-Time Password Assessment:** 
  - Evaluates password strength based on multiple criteria.
  - Provides immediate feedback on the password's strength (Very Weak, Weak, Medium, Strong, Very Strong).
  - Estimates the time it would take to crack the password using brute-force methods.
  
- **Entropy Calculation:** 
  - Calculates password entropy to determine its unpredictability and security.
  - Converts the time to crack into a readable format (seconds, minutes, days, years, centuries).

- **Character Type Indicators:** 
  - Visual indicators to show if the password includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

- **Password Generator:** 
  - Generates strong, random passwords using a combination of characters.
  - Option to view the password in plain text.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** 
  - Modern, dark-themed GUI powered by `ttkbootstrap`.
  - Full-screen mode with an easy exit option (`Escape` key).

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `ttkbootstrap` package.

You can install `ttkbootstrap` via pip:

```bash
pip install ttkbootstrap
```
## Installation
